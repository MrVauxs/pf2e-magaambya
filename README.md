# pf2e-magaambya
A module dedicated to improving your experience when playing the Strength of Thousands adventure path in the Pathfinder 2e system.

The maps and features of this module are made and commissioned with my time and money, if you want to see this module grow in maps and supplements to the Strength of Thousands adventure, you can support me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/mrvauxs) and [Patreon](https://patreon.com/mrvauxs)!

## Features:
- All Branch Benefits as Bonus Feats (best put them in Campaign Feats slot), with most of the easy automation baked in.
- An (empty) index of all students and teachers in the Magaambya. Basically a list of names and templates to fill in.
- An (empty) index of locations in Nantambu. As above, a list of names.

You will find the maps provided by the module in the PF2e Magaambya Maps adventure compendium.

Why the Adventure format? Because it includes embedded Journal Entries in the scene.
