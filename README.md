A module dedicated to improving your experience when playing the Strength of Thousands adventure path in the Pathfinder 2e system.

The maps and features of this module are made and commissioned with my time and money, if you want to see this module grow in maps and supplements to the Strength of Thousands adventure, you can support me on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/mrvauxs) and [Patreon](https://patreon.com/mrvauxs)!

## Features:
- All Branch Benefits as Bonus Feats (best put them in Campaign Feats slot), with most of the easy automation baked in.
- A fully fleshed out Spire Dormitory map, along with alternative and empty rooms for players to customize, and compatibility with Hurricane's Howl encounter!
